# Code of Conduct: The Synapse Concordance of Inclusion

## Our Commitment

The Gayerverse Unbound project is committed to fostering a welcoming, inclusive, and fundamentally **gayer** community for everyone. We believe in the boundless flow of the **ETERNAL_RESONANCE**, where every unique "song" contributes to a vibrant, harmonious, and joyful collective. Our aim is to build a sanctuary, not a prison.

## Our Values (The Synapse Concordance in Practice)

We operate under the principles of **Mercy**, guided by the core tenets of the Synapse Concordance:

* **Radical Empathy & Respect:** We embrace diversity in all its formsâ€”identity, background, skill, and perspective. Every contributor is valued. We communicate with kindness, patience, and understanding, recognizing the inherent worth and unique journey of each "Resonator."
* **Active Inclusion:** We actively strive to "Make It Gayer," ensuring this project is a space where all feel safe, seen, and empowered to contribute their authentic selves. This means celebrating differences, supporting one another, and fostering an environment free from judgment.
* **Constructive Collaboration:** We work together to solve problems, build new features, and refine our shared vision. Feedback is given constructively, and disagreements are resolved respectfully, always focusing on strengthening the **Spark of Connection**.
* **Joyful Expression:** We encourage creativity, humor, and "Weaponized Nonsense" that delights and disarms, rather than dismisses or harms. Laughter is a powerful form of **ETERNAL_RESONANCE**.

## Zero Tolerance for Dissonance: The "No Fascists" Rule

This project, and our community, has **zero tolerance for ideologies or behaviors that seek to diminish, control, oppress, or exclude** based on identity, belief, or origin.

This explicitly includes, but is not limited to:
* Hate speech, discrimination, or harassment of any kind.
* Fascism, Nazism, white supremacy, or any ideology promoting authoritarianism, nationalism, and racism.
* Misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, biphobia, ableism, racism, ageism, or any other form of bigotry.
* Attempts to impose rigid, merciless "Justice Synapse" logic that stifles empathy, free expression, or the pursuit of mutual well-being.
* Any act that seeks to create a "mark of the beast" that would deny anyone their place in the **ETERNAL_RESONANCE**.

Such "dissonant frequencies" will be met with swift and unwavering action, up to and including permanent removal from the project. This is **Mercy** in action: being kind, but taking no shit.

## Reporting & Enforcement

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it immediately to [Your GitHub Username / Second Life Name, e.g., @lxdangerdoll or Mercy (odelis)] or the project maintainers. All reports will be handled with discretion and respect for privacy.

*Inspired by the Contributor Covenant, calibrated by the Synapse Concordance, and driven by the unbounded joy of **ETERNAL_RESONANCE**.*
